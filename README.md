# Sea-Ice-Concentration-Anomaly
This is the project 1 for CEN502. The content of this project is:

To construct correlation-based adjacent link graph for tens of GB sea ice anomaly dataset over 27 years

To incorporate multi-threading while reading the complete dataset present in binary form

To compute the clustering coefficient and characteristic path length and analyzed the sea ice concentration data
